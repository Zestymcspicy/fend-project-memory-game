## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

For details, check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## How to Play

The goal is to match all the cards. When you flip a card the timer starts.  You may only have two unmatched cards flipped at a time.  Every two cards flipped counts as a move.  After ten moves, you lose a star.  After twenty moves, you lose another star.  Upon winning you can play again, or go to a really awesome website where you can learn to build a thing like this yourself!

## Installation

You can either clone this repository or download and decompress the zip file.  Go to your browser and open the index.html file in the directory where you cloned or decompressed the repository, and you're ready to go.
